PacketDroid is [Multimon](http://www.baycom.org/~tom/ham/linux/multimon.html) for Android
=========================================================================================

Right now, the only demodulator available is AFSK1200. 
After I clean up the code a little bit, it'll support all the decoders implemented by Multimon:

- AX.25
    - 1200 Baud AFSK
    - 2400 Baud AFSK (2 variants)
    - 4800 Baud HAPN
    - 9600 Baud FSK (G3RUH)
- POCSAG
    - 512 Baud
    - 1200 Baud
    - 2400 Baud
- Miscellaneous
    - DTMF
    - ZVEI

Caveat emptor
-------------

This code was put together in two afternoons. It is also my first Android application, so don't expect much.
